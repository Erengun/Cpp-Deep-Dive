# Cpp-Deep-Dive

Cpp-Deep-Dive is a repository containing in-depth modules and code for mastering advanced C++ concepts such as memory allocation, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and try/catch and exceptions.

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains my C++ code and materials related to the different modules I have worked on to learn the language. Below is a brief description of each module:

### Module 00: C++ Language Specificities

This module provides an introduction to the specific features of C++ compared to C. Through various exercises, you will learn about the differences in syntax and semantics between the two languages.

### Module 01: Memory Allocation, References, and Pointers to Members

In this module, you will learn about memory allocation in C++, how to use references and pointers to members, and the usage of the switch statement. These concepts are fundamental to understanding how C++ manages memory and how you can manipulate it to create more efficient and effective programs.

### Module 02: Ad-Hoc Polymorphism, Overloads, and Orthodox Canonical Classes

This module focuses on ad-hoc polymorphism, including overloading and orthodox canonical classes in C++. Ad-hoc polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that enables you to create flexible and reusable code.

### Module 03: Inheritance

Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows you to create new classes that are based on existing ones. In this module, you will learn about the various types of inheritance in C++ and how to use them effectively.

### Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

Subtype polymorphism is another important concept in object-oriented programming. This module covers the use of abstract classes and interfaces to create flexible and extensible code.

### Module 05: Try/Catch and Exceptions

Exception handling is an essential part of writing robust and reliable code. In this module, you will learn how to use try/catch blocks and exceptions to handle errors and ensure that your programs continue to run smoothly.

### Module 06: Different Casts

Casting is the process of converting one data type to another. In this module, you will learn about the different types of casts available in C++ and how to use them effectively.

### Module 07: Templates

Templates are a powerful feature of C++ that allow you to create generic functions and classes that can work with a wide range of data types. This module covers the basics of template syntax and usage.

### Module 08: Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms

In this module, you will learn how to use templated containers, iterators, and algorithms to create efficient and reusable code. These concepts are essential for working with large amounts of data in C++.

I hope that these resources will be useful to you as you explore and learn C++.
